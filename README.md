## Setup Instructions

### Step 1 — Flutter Environment

Ensure Flutter is installed and set up:
```bash
flutter doctor
```

### Step 2 — Clone & Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd student_assistant_app
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3 — Supabase Project Setup

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project.
2. Open the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard.
3. Paste the entire contents of `supabase_setup.sql` and click **Run**.
4. Go to **Storage** → create a bucket named `application-documents` (set to Public).

### Step 4 — Configure Supabase Credentials

Open `lib/utils/app_constants.dart` and replace the placeholder values:

```dart
static const String supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
static const String supabaseAnonKey = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
```

Find these in your Supabase dashboard under **Settings → API**.

### Step 5 — Create Test Users

In your Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication → Users**, create users manually:

**Student user:**
- Email: `student@cut.ac.za`
- Password: `student123`
- After creation, set `full_name` and `student_number` in the profiles table.

**Admin user:**
- Email: `admin@cut.ac.za`
- Password: `admin123`
- After creation, run this in the SQL Editor:
  ```sql
  UPDATE public.profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'admin@cut.ac.za';
  ```

### Step 6 — Run the App

```bash
flutter run
```

### Step 7 — Before Submission (reduce file size)

```bash
flutter clean
```
Then zip the project folder.
